# Layout

Layout is a **very** opinionated component that takes slots of React nodes as
layout elements. It is a dumb, display only component that will layout the
specific areas of the plugin.

Layout is not made responsive at this moment as I don't think that there are 
many people editing from their mobile devices.

## Usage

```ts
import { Layout } from '../components/Layout';
```

<Playground>
    <Layout
        title="Find My Blocks"
        sidebar={(
            <div>SIDEBAR</div>
        )}
        settings={(
            <Card title="Settings" toggle={true} initialOpen={false}>Some Settings</Card>
        )} 
        cards={(
            <div>CARDS</div>
        )}
    />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={ Layout } />
