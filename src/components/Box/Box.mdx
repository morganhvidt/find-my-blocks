# Box

`Box` is an empty element that accepts a `tag` and any amount of props you would
like to pass it. All props passed into a `Box` will be applied to the tag that
is used.

It is best practice to only use a `Box` element for layouts. **Do not** use it
for things like links and paragraphs.

## Usage

```ts
import { Box } from "../components/Box";
```

<Playground>
  <Box>Just a div</Box>
  <Box tag="span" className="aClass">
    Span with a class
  </Box>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Box} />
