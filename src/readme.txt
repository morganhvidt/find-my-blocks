Find my blocks is a tool to list all the blocks that are used on you WordPress site and what posts/pages they are used on.

== Description ==

Gutenberg can be a great tool to make managing content on your WordPress website easier. However after a while, updating blocks can become a hassle for developers. It is hard to keep track of what posts/pages your blocks are used on, and this makes maintaining Gutenberg a little more difficult.

Find my blocks is a tool that is here to help. With Find My Blocks you can see:

* A list of all the blocks that are used on your WordPress site.
* The amount of times a specific block has been used on your WordPress site.
* The posts/pages that a block has been used on.
* The amount of times a block has been used on a specific post/page.
* If the block is a "Reusable Block"
* Filter blocks by name to search for where a specific block was used.
